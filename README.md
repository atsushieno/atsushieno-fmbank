# atsushieno's FM (OPN) bank

This repository contains a set of FM tone definitions that I created mostly in 199x. They are unsorted and may have many overlaps, but would be still useful with projects like [jpcima/ADLplug](https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug).

It was created in classic PC-98 formats, but they are reorganized as `*.opm` files using [Wohlstand/OPN2BankEditor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPN2BankEditor) (the bank is totally for OPN, so DT2 assignment is out of scope). `*.opm` file can contain more programs than 128, but I split there as this editor supports up to 128.

This program bank is released under CC0 license.
